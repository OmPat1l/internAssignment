firebase 9 is modular in nature (tree shaking approach), ie we only mport functions which are
useful to us and not entire bundle
we use module bundle like webpack in case of conventional html js
in case of react we wont need this
creat dist and source folder (dist folder contains the index files and source is for src)
npm init -y (get dependency json)
npm  i webpack webpack-cli -D
in source file make webpack.config.js


initializeApp(firebaseConfig)
const db=getFirestore()
const colref=collection(db,"name");
addDoc deleteDoc onSnapshot doc
query(colref,where("field","equality","fieldValue")) 
onSnapshot(q,(snapshot)=>{

})
